Visualize the health and consistency of a dataset over time.  Owl will highlight the macro and micro trends  such as weekend loads vs weekday loads and behavioral item changes per day.

### DQ Over Time, Drill-In and Roll-Up

Data quality isn't a one time check or once a year project.   Data is the life blood flowing through your organization.  It's mandatory to know how your data is behaving right now, yesterday and over time to gain an understanding of the trends.  For insights to be meaningful we need to see both the lowest granularity and the big picture.  Owl's approach let's you drill all the way into the exact moment the issue arose as well as zoom out to see how your data is behaving month to month.  A Data Steward might be more concerned with a recent change in data and want to correct it using service now immediately.  Whereas a Chief Data Officer might be more concerned with the health of the organizations data overall.
