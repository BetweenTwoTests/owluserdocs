# Insurance Data

By implementing OwlDQ's real-time data analytics, insurance carriers have achieved a clear advantage. They have increased underwriting efficiency, claim data accuracy, as well as increased their customer satisfaction rating. Our predictive modeling has also increased accuracy of sales data, and the customer retention process.  When used effectively, ML driven analytics can also help insurance carriers streamline their internal processes, better manage consumer data accuracy, and improve profitability. 

Owl's Pattern Mining provides carriers with advanced data accuracy for customer application criteria.
