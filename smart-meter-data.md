# Smart Meter Data

OwlDQ's Smart Meter Data Analytics provides accurate and predictable data quality to companies often inundated with massive amounts of data and aging enterprise systems.  

The U.S. smart meter data management market forecast is projected to reach $556.94 million by 2026. In 2018, U.S. electric utilities had about 86.8 million advanced \(smart\) metering installations. OwlDQ provides an automated process to manage the mountain of data collected, and glean critical business insights. By applying our ML algorithms during the normal data ingestion cycles Owl uncovered $10 million dollars in unbilled revenue for a leading US Energy Company.

In the example below, Owl reduced the time, cost, and maintenance, associated with data quality by up to 60%. We also detected 200 dropped records from the previous data run.
