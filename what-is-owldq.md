# What is OwlDQ

OwlDQ is an all-in-one tool that reduces the time spent implementing data monitoring.

{% hint style="info" %}
###  **On average, 60% of a data professional's time is consumed by data quality. It takes far too long to analyze and validate the data.** 
{% endhint %}

1. _This **taxes every other department** that relies on the data_ 
2. _This leaves your organization **vulnerable to data quality issues**._ 

## What Actually Happens

The BIGGEST issues are the things you never expect.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Billing Issue Example" %}
| "An unexpected conversion occurred during a migration that changed our up-to-date-payments indicator from TRUE/FALSE to 1/0. Needless to say, we were very surprised when invoices were not sent. The rework and reconciliation were super painful. An enormous amount of my time was wasted." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Financial Data Example" %}
| "One of our 200+ reference data feeds introduced a pipe \(\|\) into a position field. The field was defined as VARCHAR so this was allowed. Our models went crazy and we thought we breached risk limits. We ended up selling out of positions \(losing millions\). Only to uncover the root cause much later that week." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="API Example" %}
| "We pull data from many APIs. One platform accounts for 10% of enrichment activities \(i.e. how we monetize our data\). Our auth token accidentally had a daily quota imposed, yet job control said green light \(successful connection\). We still loaded some rows \(1k\), just not entire payloads. This was super nuanced. We literally lost ~10% revenue that month." |
| :--- |
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="IoT / Meter Example" %}
| "When we introduced new meters, they were hooked up and sending valid readings. They were valid values within valid ranges. Turned out their default setting was rounding the actual values and we were losing precision. Devastating, considering the amount of precision required with blood values." |

OwlDQ provides Low Effort, High Stakes protection against these types of data "_surprises_". **In the end, you're only as good as the rules you thought to write.**

## Low Effort, High Stakes Protection.

Do more with fewer resources.

Whether you're getting started or applying advanced controls, OwlDQ is an all-in-one, [purpose-built](https://docs.owl-analytics.com/what-is-owldq#purpose-built-one-focus) software to boost your data monitoring efforts. OwlDQ enables organizations to quickly do things that would _**otherwise take months to develop and cost significantly more.**_

{% hint style="danger" %}
* Data teams overwhelmed with tickets 
* Business users find issues first
* Touchy pipelines get upset with minor updates
* Too busy responding to fire drills to implement new projects
{% endhint %}

## **Purpose-Built \(One Focus\)**

{% hint style="info" %}
### _Every feature, visual, and component within Owl is intended to make the analysis and implementation of data quality easier._
{% endhint %}

Owl was designed with 4 KPI's in mind:

**Speed -** Owl will check that data is valid, complete, accurate, and consistent.  Data Quality is derived from intuitive clicks, not unnecessary code. Our goal is to deliver DQ in minutes, not days or weeks. 

**Scale -**  Owl considers scale from two perspectives. From a technical viewpoint, OwlDQ is designed to work in distributed and elastic environments. It can scan any data from any location. The other piece is usability. Creating a tool that will scale to additional users, outside of a few experts, is equally important.  

**Unification -**   OwlDQ will scan files the same way as a database so you can do all in your data monitoring in one place, rather than piecemeal approaches.  Data quality needs to be unified to have a single normalized view of data health.

**Measurement -** You can't manage what you can't measure. It's important to get macro and micro views of data quality, the ability to compare between different departments, and time periods.

### Trust

Because showing someone a housing report with incorrect estimated housing values or a stock report with the wrong stock prices wonâ€™t go over well. Consistent data monitoring helps you sleep better at night, but also lets the business know they can trust the data. 

## **Core Components**

Owl offers a full DQ suite to cover the unique challenges of each dataset. 

[See Complete Feature List Breakdown For More Information](https://owldq.com/features.html)

**9 Dimensions of DQ**

1. Behavior - Metadata monitoring
2. Rules - SQL-based rules engine
3. Outliers - Anomalous records
4. Pattern - Classification, cross-column & parent/child anomalies 
5. Source - Source to target reconciliation
6. Record - Deltas for a given column\(s\)
7. Schema - When columns are added or dropped
8. Dupes - Fuzzy matching, Identify similar but not exact entries
9. Shapes - Typos and Formatting Anomalies
