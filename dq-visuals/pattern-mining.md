# Pattern Mining

Owl uses the latest advancements in data science and ML to find deep patterns across millions of rows and columns. In the example below it noticed that Valerie is likely the same user as she has the same customer\_id and card\_number but recently showed up with a different last name. Possible misspelling or data quality issue?

## Fraud Detection?

Think about a scenario where a dataset has a SSN column along with FNAME, LNAME and many others. What if your traditional rules engine passes because one of the rows has a valid SSN and a valid Name but the SSN doesn't belong to that person \(his or her name and address, etc...\)? This is where data mining can derive more sophisticated insights than a rules based approach.
