# Insurance Data

By implementing OwlDQ's real-time data analytics, insurance carriers have achieved a clear advantage. They have increased underwriting efficiency, claim data accuracy, as well as increased their customer satisfaction rating. Our predictive modeling has also increased accuracy of sales data, underwriting, and the customer retention process.  When used effectively, ML driven analytics can also help insurance carriers streamline their processes, better manage consumer data, and improve profitability. 

In the below example OwlDQ automatically finds abnormalities in the claim data, and assures accurate claim settlement.
