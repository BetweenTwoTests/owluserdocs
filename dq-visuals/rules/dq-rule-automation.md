# DQ Rule Automation

The best Data Quality rule is one you don't have to write!  

Owl's semantic automatically writes standard rules, and shares all of it's out of the box rules with each user/tenant.  This makes it easy to get started quickly and let the team add common rules for specific use-cases.  Owl self identifies standard columns and automatically provides the proper protection.
